## 🔐 Access control

- Plans belong to the signed-in user who submitted them (better-auth session). `GET /api/plans` lists only the caller's plans, and `GET`/`DELETE /api/plans/[id]` plus `POST /api/plans/[id]/retry` return 404 for plans owned by someone else. Unauthenticated API calls return 401.
- The FastAPI `POST /api/plan/trigger` endpoint is meant to be called only by the Next.js server. Set the same random value for `TRIPCRAFT_INTERNAL_API_TOKEN` in `backend/.env` and `client/.env.local`; the client sends it as `X-TripCraft-Internal-Token`. If the variable is unset, the backend accepts loopback callers only, which keeps local development working.
